  Modified 2012 by Todd Krein (todd@krein.org) to implement repeated starts
  Modified 2017 by Chuck Todd (ctodd@cableone.net) to correct Unconfigured Slave Mode reboot
  Modified 2019-2021 by Spence Konde for megaTinyCore and DxCore.
  This version is part of megaTinyCore and DxCore; it is not expected
  to work with other hardware or cores without modifications.
  Modified extensively 2021-22 by MX682X for megaTinyCore and DxCore.
  Added Support for Simultaneous host/client, dual mode and Wire1.

 *            This is of great utility for communication with lower voltage devices, especially where you don't have MVIO. Can also be set independently if dual mode used.
